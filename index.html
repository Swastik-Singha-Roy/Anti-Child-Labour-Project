            <div class="heading">What is Child Labour?</div>
            <div class="text">The International Labour Organisation defines child labour as any work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, their dignity and one that is harmful to the physical and mental development of the child. It includes work that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous to children. Work that interferes with a childâ€™s ability to attend and participate in school fully by obliging them to leave school prematurely; or requiring them to try to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work is also child labour. It is both a cause and consequence of poverty. In India, a "Child" as defined by the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act of 2016 as a person who has not completed 14 years of age.</div>
            <div class="heading">Child labour in India</div>
            <div class="text">India sadly is home to the largest number of child labourers in the world. A growing phenomenon is children being used as domestic workers in urban areas. The conditions in which children work are completely unregulated and they are often made to work without food, with very low wages, resembling slavery. There are cases of physical and emotional abuse of child domestic workers. A Ministry of Labour notification has made child domestic work as well as employment of children in dhabas, tea stalls and restaurants "hazardous" occupations.</div>
            <div class="heading">Our mission</div>
            <div class="text">We strive to be a catalyst for change in the fight against child labor.  Our platform empowers individuals and communities by raising awareness about the exploitation and hardship children face. We make reporting suspected cases of child labor safe, easy, and accessible.  By connecting those who report with the right resources and authorities, we ensure effective intervention.  Furthermore, we advocate for legislative changes, stronger enforcement, and programs that tackle poverty and promote education, dismantling the root causes that keep children in forced labor. </div>
